# Realm
Creating, retrieving and managing realms and also enabling, disabling and checking per realm security status.

[Realms](/concepts/realms) are routing and administrative domains that act as namespaces. All resources in Bondy belong to a Realm. Messages are routed separately for each individual realm so sessions attached to a realm wonâ€™t see message routed on another realm.
