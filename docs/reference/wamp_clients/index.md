# WAMP Client Libraries
To write distributed application components in your favorite language, you will need a WAMP client library so that your component can connect to Bondy.

::: tip Bondy clients
We are working on the development of several OSS client libraries ourselves too, we will link them here when ready e.g. Erlang/Elixir, Android and iOS clients.
:::

There are community-maintained client libraries implementations for most popular programming languages. The WAMP Specification website has an [up-to-date list](https://wamp-proto.org/implementations.html#libraries) of community-supported client libraries.


## Highlights
The following is a pre-selection of libraries we have been using and/or we know people are using with Bondy.

### JavaScript

* [AutobahnJS](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js) - WAMP client library for both browsers and NodeJS using Promises.
* [Wampy](https://github.com/KSDaemon/wampy.js) - Feature-rich, zero dependency (by default) WAMP Javascript implementation (for browser and NodeJS)

### Python

* [AutobahnPython](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python) - WAMP client library + WebSocket client/server impl. for Python 2 and 3, on Twisted and asyncio.

### Go
* [Nexus](https://github.com/gammazero/nexus) - designed for highly concurrent asynchronous I/O.

### Java
* [Autobahn Java](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java) - WebSocket & WAMP in Java for Android and Java 8.
* Jawampa

### Erlang

* [wamp_client](https://gitlab.com/leapsight/wamp_client)
