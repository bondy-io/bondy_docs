## Authmethod

Below the list the supported authentication methods:

- `anonymous`: Allows access to clients which connect without credentials, assigning them as members of the 'anonymous' group. You can configure the allowed sources for the anonymous user and the permissions assigned to the anonymous group - but you cannot make the anonymous group a member of another group.
- `password`: Allows access to clients which connect with an existing username (WAMP authid field) and password, where the password is send in clear-text and is therefore vulnerable to password “sniffing” attacks, unless the connection is protected by TLS encryption. It should be avoided and replaced by the use of **wamp-cra** or **wamp-scram** challenge-response methods if possible.
- `oauth2`
- `trust`: Allows access to clients which connect with an existing username (WAMP authid field) but does not request them to authenticate. This is to be used in conjunction with source definition e.g. trust only clients within a defined network (CIDR).
- `cookie`
- `wampcra`
- `cryptosign`
- `wamp-scram`
- `ticket`: Allows access to clients which connect with an existing username (WAMP authid field) and a ticket previously generated by Bondy. If the transport is not encrypted, this method is vulnerable to ticket “sniffing” attacks, a man-in-the-middle can sniff and possibly hijack the ticket. If the ticket value is reused, that might enable replay attacks. It should be used only when the connection is protected by TLS encryption.
- `tls`

## Active Anti-entropy (AAE)

AAE is a periodic automatic synchronisation protocol used by Bondy to remove inconsistencies between data replicas (aka [Entropy](#entropy)). Bondy uses it to proactively identify and repair inconsistent or missing data across all nodes in the cluster.

Bondy uses a Push-Pull Anti-entropy strategy.

When performed, cluster nodes tell each other about the keys and what versions they have (using [Merkle Trees](#merkle-trees). If they notice a divergence then they start sending each other the differing keys. If a key has conflicting values Bondy will run a conflict resolution function (different entities in Bondy use different conflict resolution functions).

## Convergence

## Entropy

In a distributed system like Bondy, conflicts between object replicas stored on different cluster nores are an expected by product of node failure, concurrent client updates, physical data loss and corruption, and other events that distributed systems are built to handle.

These conflicts occur when objects are either:

- **missing**, as when one node holds a replica of the object and another node does not, or
- **divergent**, as when the values of an existing object differ across nodes.



## Merkle Trees
A Merkle Tree is a hash tree where leaves are hashes of the values of individual keys. Parent nodes are hashes of their respective children.

This feature helps to recover data loss in the event of disk corruption.
