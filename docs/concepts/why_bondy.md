# Why Bondy
> Bondy is an open source application networking platform that connects all elements of a distributed application, from web and mobile apps to IoT devices and backend services, allowing everything to talk using one single, simple protocol.{.definition}

## TL;DR
Delivering innovative customer experiences today requires the real-time **networked connection of people, process, data and things (devices)**. Advances in technology so far have facilitated some of the tasks involved, but the overall process has become shockingly complicated, putting projects at risk.

This results in a complex technology solution prone to inefficiencies, delays and fatigue hindering the success of business initiatives.

Bondy is our contribution to solve the problem and it was born out of our own necessity. Bondy is an easy to use platform that allows any software talk to any other software, anywhere, in any programming language, securely and reliably, using multiple communication patterns and requiring a **single unifying protocol** and a **single infrastructure component**.
